awesome understanding! I want to build an practical, production ready and full featured web e-commerce platform for a Singapore based small to medium sized company - refer to the frontend web design mockup in 3 static component files below. now, please think deeper and think harder to thoroughly and systematically explore how best to re-imagine a complete codebase architecture for the website with the same frontend design. then meticulously plan and create the detailed comprehensive `Project Architecture Document` with file hierarchy diagram with listing of key files and their description, mermaid diagrams to show the application flowcharts and the database schema.

---

Now, please meticulously review and analyze @CLAUDE.md , @Project_Architecture_Document.md and @docs/Comprehensive_Project_Understanding.md to have a deep understanding of what you will be building. Next, meticulously review @MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN.md , them proceed according to the plan phase-by-phase and step-by-step.

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically to examine the current dynamic landing page `landing_page.html` and compare it with the reference static HTML mockup represented by 3 component files @index.html, @main.js and @styles.css. The issue is that the dynamic landing page is still looking "messed up" in the browser. I need you to critically compare the dynamic HTML with the static HTML mockup to find out the root cause. You can review the actual frontend code files in the attached bundle set `codebase_frontend_files_set.md` to validate your findings and assumptions to finalize your analysis and recommendations.

Awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Now, please review the dynamic landing page for the frontend, @landing_page.html , and then compare it against the static HTML reference mock-up represented by 3 component files: @index.html , @main.js and @styles.css . Carefully and systematically identify any visual UI/UX aesthetic deviation of the dynamic landing page from that of the static HTML mock-up. Next, validate the @gap_analysis_dynamic_land_page_vs_static.md and @gap_analysis_remediation_plan.md against your deep understanding and insights from your own comparative analysis. Note that the current frontend code is intentionally using custom BEM classes. Meticulously plan to create your own validated remedial plan with ToDo to close the visual UI/UX aesthetic alignment gap **while not affecting the architecutural integrity and functionality of the platform**. Review and validate your own remedial plan before proceeding to execute it.

**Goal:** Close the visual UI/UX aesthetic gap between the Next.js dynamic landing page and the static HTML mockup reference, while preserving architectural integrity and functionality.
